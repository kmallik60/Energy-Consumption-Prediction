# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

Introduction :
The Motivation of this Project is Climate Change. Seeing ourselves in the turmoil we are in due to excess release of greenhouse gases (CO2, Methane, Nitrous Oxide etc.) through transportation, burning coal, oil and gas, deforestation and many man-made disasters. Though Climate Change is caused by many different factors, the main cause remains to be ENERGY CONSUMPTION by excessive burning of Fossil Fuels to create energy. Global Energy demand for cooling has more than tripled since 1990â€™s, and without any efficiency standards the demand could triple or quadruple from now until 2040 which can even rapidly impact the environment. It is expected that 4 billion people will buy Air Conditioner by 2050. The building operations like Heating, Cooling account for 28% of total greenhouse gas emissions. It costs a lot to cool or heat the building in terms of environmental impact. The Aim of this project is to predict the energy consumption in a building, which is through the HVAC Systems (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems). The amount of energy consumed is directly proportional to the impact on environment. This project is a small step in identifying the energy consumptions which can be helpful to make improvements in HVAC systems to reduce the carbon impact on the world.

Algorithms used:
1) XGBoost
2) LGBM
3) Linear Regression
4) CatBoost

Data:
We have 3 files which are need to run the notebook.
They are :
1) Weather metadata file
2) Building Metadata File
3) As the link of 3rd file is huge, we have uploaded that in the google drive : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zV2nkn9nPB0dNRrvJWBCmmf_pGfzDmkp/view?usp=sharing

Requirements to run this notebook are mentioned in the "requirements.txt" file in this repository.
